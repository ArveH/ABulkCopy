# A database copy tool

Currently only used to copy tables from an SQL Server database to a Postgres database.

Eventually, I plan to turn it into a general copy tool for copying all schema and data from one database to another. It can be SQL Server to SQL Server, Postgres to Postgres, or between SQL Server and Postgres.
